    <h1>🌍 Welcome to Piglatinia</h1>
    <p>You won’t find Piglatinia on most maps — unless the map is printed in Pig Latin and shaped like a hula hoop. This glorious, peculiar nation is hidden just northeast of Who-Knows-Where and surrounded by the Sea of Whimsy.</p>
    <p>It’s a land full of laughter, wordplay, flying hoops, and the occasional runaway juggling pin. Here, Pig Latin isn’t a novelty — it’s simply the language everyone’s spoken since birth. No one questions it. No one translates it. They just live it.</p>

    <h2>🌀 Language & Life</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pig Latin is the native language. It’s spoken at home, in schools, on government forms, and even in bedtime lullabies.</li>
      <li>Visitors may be confused. Locals won’t notice.</li>
      <li>Most Piglatinians are completely unaware that their language is considered unusual anywhere else.</li>
      <li>“Itway ustjay akesmay ensesay otay usyay.”</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>The Spiral Tower of Loops</li>
      <li>The annual Flip-Your-Words Festival</li>
      <li>A public transit system powered entirely by hula hoopers on roller skates</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💃 Traditions & National Pastimes</h2>

      <li>Education</li>
      <li>Political debates</li>
      <li>Fire drills</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🎪 Juggling</h3>
    <p>A newer cultural trend, introduced by a mysterious traveler named Gregor, who brought three juggling balls and a strong sense of rhythm. Within weeks, Piglatinians declared it “a perfect complement to hooping.” Now, juggling-while-hooping is a national art form. It is called Rings of Gravity.</p>

    <h2>🧍‍♀️ About the Lonely Pig Latin Lady</h2>
    <p>Once a proud citizen of Piglatinia, she ventured to America to share her culture. But people didn’t understand her.</p>
    <p>She spoke fluently. They blinked.<br>
    She laughed. They shuffled away.<br>
    She wore a hoop on her belt. A man at Walgreens asked if it was a life preserver.</p>
    <p>Crushed but undeterred, she created LearnPigLatin.com to teach, inspire, and connect. Now, through posters, books, stickers, and silliness, she’s helping people everywhere experience the joy of Piglatinia — one flipped word at a time.</p>
