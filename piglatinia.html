  <h1>🌍 Welcome to Piglatinia</h1>
  <p>You won’t find Piglatinia on most maps — unless the map is printed in Pig Latin and shaped like a hula hoop. This glorious, peculiar nation is hidden just northeast of Who-Knows-Where and surrounded by the Sea of Whimsy.</p>
  <p>It’s a land full of laughter, wordplay, flying hoops, and the occasional runaway juggling pin. Here, Pig Latin isn’t a novelty — it’s simply the language everyone’s spoken since birth. No one questions it. No one translates it. They just live it.</p>

  <h2>🌀 Language & Life</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Pig Latin is the native language. It’s spoken at home, in schools, on government forms, and even in bedtime lullabies.</li>
    <li>Visitors may be confused. Locals won’t notice.</li>
    <li>Most Piglatinians are completely unaware that their language is considered unusual anywhere else.</li>
    <li>“Itway ustjay akesmay ensesay otay usyay.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🏛️ Capital City: Atinlay Ouncay</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Spiral Tower of Loops</li>
    <li>The annual Flip-Your-Words Festival</li>
    <li>A public transit system powered entirely by hula hoopers on roller skates</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💃 Traditions & National Pastimes</h2>
  <strong>🔀 Hula Hooping</strong>
  <p>Considered the oldest and most sacred tradition. It’s used in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Meditation</li>
    <li>Education</li>
    <li>Political debates</li>
    <li>Fire drills</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It’s said that the first Piglatinian baby was born mid-hoop. (That baby grew up to invent shoulder hooping.)</p>

  <strong>🎪 Juggling</strong>
  <p>A newer cultural trend, introduced by a mysterious traveler named Gregor. Within weeks, juggling-while-hooping became a national art form called <em>Rings of Gravity</em>.</p>

  <h2>🧳 Meet the Lonely Pig Latin Lady</h2>
  <p>Once a proud Piglatinian, she ventured to America to share her culture. But people didn’t understand her.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>She spoke fluently. They blinked.</li>
    <li>She laughed. They shuffled away.</li>
    <li>She wore a hoop. Someone asked if it was a life preserver.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Crushed but determined, she built LearnPigLatin.com — a bridge between Piglatinia and the world.</p>
  <p>Every printable, product, and page is designed by her, straight from the heart of her homeland.</p>
